<h2>History</h2><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/RAiD_History_.jpg"></div><p><strong>2018: Igniting the Spark of Innovation:</strong></p><p>The year 2018 marked a pivotal moment for the RSAF, with the launch of SWiFT movement. Recognising the vast potential of ground-up innovation, SWiFT Office aimed to empower and equip Airmen with the tools and resources to tackle challenges head-on. It played a crucial role in this endeavour, fostering a culture of creativity and spearheading the development of both digital and non-digital products. These solutions weren't just technological marvels; they streamlined processes, enhanced operations, and laid the groundwork for a future brimming with possibilities.</p><p><strong>2019: Embracing the Digital Wave:</strong></p><p>As the digital landscape rapidly evolved, AELO recognised the need to adapt and thrive. To harness the power of emerging technologies, a strategic decision was made to hone our digital competencies in data analytics, computer science, and programming. The supply chain engineering (SCE) community emerged as a natural partner, their deep focus on IT systems and data-driven operations proving to be an invaluable asset. Consequently, the Digital &amp; Supply Chain Engineering (DSE) unit was formed, bringing together talent from both domains to cultivate a skilled workforce equipped to navigate the ever-changing digital terrain.</p><p><strong>2020: Building A Future Powered by Data:</strong></p><p>The year 2020 witnessed the establishment of the RSAF data office, a foresightful move anticipating the increasing integration of machine learning and AI into RSAF operations. Recognising the limitations of solely relying on outsourced expertise, the data office championed the training and development of RSAF servicemen in data science. This strategic approach ensured that not only could models be built and trained effectively, but also that their application remained fit for purpose and aligned with specific domain needs. In-house experts, equipped with both technical prowess and deep operational understanding, became the driving force behind data-driven decision-making and intelligent systems.</p><p><strong>2020-2021: Forging Resilience in the Face of Adversity:</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic tested the RSAF's resilience and adaptability like never before. It was during this time that SWiFT's "coalition of the willing" rose to the challenge, conceptualising and developing the SWiFTMed and SWiFTCobra apps. These innovative tools were testaments to the power of DevSecOps principles, demonstrating how in-house teams could deliver operational agility and data-driven insights in the midst of a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. SWiFTMed, a multi-functional mobile app, empowered the last man with the tools to combat the pandemic, enabling efficient temperature logging, contact tracing, and rapid response capabilities. SWiFTCobra, on the other hand, revolutionised data management and analysis for the health surveillance task force, eventually migrating to the Ministry of Health for wider application.</p><p><strong>2021: RAiD - The Convergence of Innovation:</strong></p><p>With a solid foundation laid and valuable lessons learned, 2021 witnessed the internal beta launch of RAiD. This ambitious initiative unified the strengths of three synergistic entities: the SWiFT Office, the RSAF Data Office, and the Cyber Defence Branch. This convergence marked a new era of collaboration, bringing together diverse expertise and fostering a dynamic environment where innovation could flourish. As RAiD grows, its impact expands, promising to propel the RSAF into a future defined by cutting-edge solutions, agile responsiveness, and unwavering commitment to serving the needs of the RSAF.Founding Stories</p><h2>Founding Stories</h2><p><strong>COMING SOON!</strong></p>
