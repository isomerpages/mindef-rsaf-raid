CelebRAiD2! RAiD turns 2!

Yesterday, RAiD celebRAiDed our 2nd anniversary with a simple gathering with our vendor partners, alumni, NSmen and "Friends of the RAiDers". 

The theme for RAiD's OKR this year is hashtag#Grow. As we did a recap of our history, my heart was filled with gladness as I reflected on how, despite the odds, RAiD has grown in strength and credibility, as it grows Smarts & Smiles for our Air Force and airmen.

CelebRAiD was also a day of thanksgiving, for RAiD has many people to thank. Other than our RAiDers who has stayed on to fight for our cause, we also recognised:

1. Our RAiD alumni who have helped built RAiD. Some continue to support us from afar. (Welcome back, Jonathan Ng, Tan Kah Ming, Ryan Tan, Vivek Nair, Timothy L.)
2. Our RAiD Coalition of the Willing NSmen for your spirit of volunteerism. (Good to see you, Timothy Tan, Daniel Khoo, Steven Tan Jit Hwee)
3. Our vendor partners who grows with us. Ollion
3. 2 inductees into the 2023 RAiD Hall of Friend, Donovan and Prema, who have walked the extra mile with RAiD even when they didn't have to.

Thank you all for being part of RAiD's adventure. 
Let's raid on in the year ahead!
